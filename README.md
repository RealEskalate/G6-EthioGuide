## üèó Architecture

This project is built using a feature-driven **Clean Architecture** approach, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between layers. This makes the codebase scalable, maintainable, and highly testable.

- **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic, entities, and use case contracts. It has no dependencies on any other layer.
- **Data Layer:** Implements the repositories defined in the Domain Layer. It is responsible for orchestrating data from various sources (remote API, local cache, device SDKs).
- **Presentation Layer:** The UI of the application, built with Flutter. State management is handled reactively using the **BLoC** pattern, separating UI from business logic.
